# Playmakers - Intro to Unity Workshop
A small 2D minigame where you play as an office worker that has overslept and needs to find a way to leave the building! Explore different rooms and find Keycards to help you leave the building via the Elevator.

This was a small project created for the Playmakers Intro to Unity Workshop in March 2024, to teach the basics of using the Unity game engine. Playmakers is a game development society at the University of Technology Sydney.
